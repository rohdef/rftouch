# RfTouch - Sencha Touch 2 library
Currently offers a ReloadStore, which help automating retries on remote services. 
This is probably mostly useful when packing your Sencha Touch product inside a native app.

__Upcomming__: RfMap, and Ext.Map that handles connectivity problems.

# Getting started
Download the RfTouch folder, and put it inside your project. Add the project to the 
loader and start using the library like any other Sencha Touch 2 code.

For an example of the usage please read [RfTouch sees light](http://rohdef.dk/wp3/?p=176) 
and take a look at the tests, which also show the usage. A JsDuck documentation is 
on it's way.
