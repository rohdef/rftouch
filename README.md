# RfTouch - Sencha Touch 2 library
Currently it's in its initial phase, so nothing much to see here... yet :D

# Running tests
To run the tests is quite simple, first you have to install buterjs by running:

  npm install -g buster

After that you run your run the command:

  buster-server

in an terminal, and navigate your browser to the given address (most likely http://localhost:1111 ) and press the capture browser button.
After that navigate your terminal to the test-setup folder and run:

  buster-test
